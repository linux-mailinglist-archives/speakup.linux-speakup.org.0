Probably a dead package by now.  For that reason if I can figure it out
one thing that would help the package would be to make it
bittorrent-agnostic to the extent if bittorrent cannot be found it would
search for other bittorrent clients and use them.  Archlinux has no
bittorrent package on it though slint has bittorrent and podracer
available for podcast downloading.  Podracer worked well in the past and I
found out about it from this list so figured it wouldn't be off topic to
mention it here.
