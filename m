Hello,

Chime Hart, le mer. 13 mai 2020 22:11:23 -0700, a ecrit:

That is expected.
The question is not about the pitch, but about the intonation. According
to the manual, the second command should have more intonation than the
first, and the thirs should have the same amount of intonation as the
second.
