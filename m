Well, its really nice owning a ChromeBook, nice-and-light weight, with quite 
good Android sounding speech. However, ChromeVox seems to be missing many of the 
well-thought out reading commands which we use in a flat review in Speakup. So, 
considering there are at least 2 types of Linux versions you can run inside of a 
ChromeBook, I wondered if there were a way of running Speakup, maybe from a VM 
Shell? I would certainly wanna keep the speech the way it is, but use the 
functions of Speakup. An only challenge I can think of, Chrome Books don't use 
nor have a num pad, so unless there were a way of an alternative keyboard 
configuration? Also, the fact that we can alter the sources list-and-Speakup is 
supposedly included? I use flat review probably more than anything, but an only 
way of sort of looking around a screen in Chrome OS is with a sticky kees 
option. So this is quite in reverse of when Kirk ran ChromeVox in Linux. Thanks 
so much in advance
Chime
