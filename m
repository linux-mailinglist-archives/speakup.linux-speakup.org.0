Hello All,

I have a radio that is in 2 parts. A embedded linux system and a =
Software Defined Radio. The embedded linux is very slim but easy to =
access. I can log into it via a terminal emulator. It is using anArm =
processor. As I have several Raspberry Pi boards, I guess I could build =
a kernel or its modules on a Pi. Because I probably wouldn't be able to =
build a development environment on it. As it is rather buggy there are =
frequent updates which appears just to replace the root file system. So =
any settings are just written over. I think it would be rather easy to =
mount the update on a loopback and rebuild it when finished hacking.

So how would I investigate any possibility of getting speakup working? =
Or am I just barking again!!!

Thanks,


Georgina
