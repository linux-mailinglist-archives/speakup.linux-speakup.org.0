John,
It is considered common  human decency to understand when you are told that=
=20
your  communications are not welcome.
We are not having a debate.
You are on a quest to insist you are right about  others sharing a label=20
with you..and I am not going to agree, ever..
do. not. write. me. privately..I will post it to the list.
Consider the debate over, or whatever you require to support your sense of=
=20
self.  But stop harassing me.
I write the dictionary for me personally around what is harassment.
