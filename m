Well, we are hoping to upgrade my hardware, but its a challenge finding geer 
with an rs232 port. So an obvious question? Has their been any progress in 
creating such a driver with Speakup? Otherwise, looks as if I will have to wait 
til April to enjoy those Vocal-izer voices. Thanks so much in advance for any 
guidance
Chime
