Chime,
as I am currently learning voiceover, drop me a private note with some 
questions.
If you mean running Linux  commands via the Mac terminal, many people on 
the mac visionaries list do this many times a day.  some use voiceover 
there  too, some use another screen reader, although I am unsure about 
speakup.
As for the keystrokes?
well, depending on the machine and macos you get, one can still attach a 
full sized keyboard via USB,
but, much to my surprise, even with my somewhat smaller hands, at some 
point the  keystrokes will feel more natural.
Indeed, you can not only reduce those  keystrokes, but  You can use the menu 
bar to shorten a great deal.
Which voice is resonating for you?
best off list I suspect,
Karen
