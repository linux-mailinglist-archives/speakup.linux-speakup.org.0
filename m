Can you share the link to your excellent  w3c research on captcha issues?
Patreon has now added cloudflare, after recently claiming, with ACB help, 
that they were working on wACG  compliance.
while I realize your article is not official w3c policy, it is both 
detailed, and informative, with my wanting to direct their accessibility 
team to the information.
Thanks,
Karen
