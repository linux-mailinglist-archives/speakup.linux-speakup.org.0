Actually, While I imagine that dectalk will be snapped up rather quickly 
sigh, I have a question?
Can anyone provide details about  those battery sources, or enough 
information to  hunt them down?
Once  sent a dectalk express in for repair, only to have the person keep 
the battery and having one is rather  important to me.
Thanks,
Kare
