I echo this attitude concern, but for a different reason.
who gets to decide what bodies  deserve a place at the table?
because of a vascular accident in an eye surgery, I experience a brain 
anomaly where certain frequencies stimulate the dizzy centres of my brain.
allot of those frequencies happen in poorly designed software  speech 
configurations for Linux.
Meaning, because little effort has been made to give choices for Linux 
speech in the gui, if I wanted to use this, I would have to choose between 
a Linux computer and hospitalization.
compare this with apple hardware.
I recently aquired a  mid 2012 macbook pro which, because of how the 
voiceover   sound is produced is perfectly safe for my use..and I can 
still run  only one  Mac os off  from the last pre m.1 systems.
i have an associate in my office running their business on a 2011 macbook 
pro.
Indeed climate change, landfill issues, available resources in terms of 
training and access all over the world.
And, for many how their body works mandates choices.
There was a time when one of the great things about Linux was that it 
could be used to breathe  new life into older hardware.  especially 
helpful in  non-western countries where getting the fastest car on the 
road was costly.
If your attitude was the rule though, those folks regardless of abilities 
might never get computers at all.
  take your attitude and say substitute braille.
  Statistically less than 10% of the blindness community are braille users, 
meaning the majority do not  use it, or even learn it if newly blinded.
so, its unfortunate some blind people are still stuck needing volumes and 
volumes of braille, but  to expect the world to confirm to such a limited 
use language etc.
Speaking personally, especially given how flexible Linux is  supposed to 
be?
deciding some have no place at your gui table is little different than 
deciding those who are visible minorities, no matter the location, have no 
place at the table either.
