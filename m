Profound apologies...its been a deeply stressful time.
When I ran pkunzip it opened just fine.
I do have a question though.
I note no install, does that mean I need only say  run dt.bat for the 
drivers to run?
i. e. place that in my autoexec.bat?
I want to test things before doing that  if I can.
Goal is running it with business vision.
Thanks,
