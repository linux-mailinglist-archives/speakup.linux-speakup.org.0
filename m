Hi,
Interesting, they don't list the .ca domain in their offer online.

Hi there,
Just wondering, how much were they going to charge you?
All of my domain, save the one here in Canada are with gkg.net www.gkg.net.
I spend on average $12 a year,  with the amazing ability to update with them
on the phone.
Even my Canadian domain with bare medal
www.baremedal.ca  I hope lol, is little more than $14.
why is yours so expensive?
just wondering,
Kare
