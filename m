Well, I certainly  said nothing  negatived regarding Samuel's devotion. 
frankly i find his feeling my words judged what he provides  so harshly a 
surprise.
Still,   that it took more than 16  years for Debian to declare speakup 
stable, that something as  important as inflection is only now even 
noticed, and that many involved with testing accessibility  from a w3c-wai 
standpoint do not even consider Linux, let alone Speakup as  worthy of 
inclusion in their testing says a great deal.
Karen
