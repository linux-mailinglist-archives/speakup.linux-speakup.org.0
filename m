Hi Jason,
Certainly respect your stance.
Speaking personally, because my physical experience is somewhat unique, 
what some call old for me is often life critical where connecting is 
concerned.
My goal for this card is indeed a backup for my preferred synthesis, my 
reading edge.
Still intend locating  the Macbook pro most suitable for my experiences 
though, providing a different kind of backup.
for now, happily tapping the case of the newly built just last week 
machine meeting my needs, I will explore how to incorporate this backup 
option.
Kare
