I'm sorry, but this is a very irresponsible attitude, given the impact
of climate change.  And now on top of that, the world is coping with
supply chain issues.  "Chuck it in a landfill because it won't run the
latest Electron app" is deeply unacceptable.

I do agree with you about the importance of GUI accessibility, even
though I only use one when circumstances force me to it.  I'm somewhat
optimistic about the recent news.
