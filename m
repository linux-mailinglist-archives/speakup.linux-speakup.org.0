Jookia,
I am only going to address one point of yours from below.
That is your stating that because something is expensive as you define it, 
others might prefer a cli solution instead.
Once more I stress  speaking for myself,  that it depends.
There is a concept in sales, in any exchange really, that refers to cost 
vs. 
value.
If a person has a $5 problem, and you have a $500 solution, they are 
unlikely to buy from you because your solution, even if that $5 problem 
is important, does not match the value for them.
Same applies if they have a $50,000 problem, and you have a $5,000 
solution.   The costs is nothing when compared with the value.
Sitting next to my hand as I type is a machine that when first sold cost 
$5,500.
In addition to providing speech synthesis, I am not using it for that role 
just now, the machine reads the printed page. In fact with the correct 
software card, it can do this in several languages. One can type into 
stored  print material in braille, can transfer that print material into a 
word processor, those sorts of things.
I have only needed to get a new edition of the machine twice since 1992, 
and one of those times was due to stupidity of an airline staff member 
ignoring my requests.
It is portable, I use it in libraries to likewise  read materials i cannot 
get elsewhere.
In fact I am about to seek another edition of the unit, I prefer having a 
spare.
Now compare the cost  to me as a media professional, staffing people to 
read for me, to transcribe materials, to manage translations and so forth.
Speaking personally, the cost of  finding comparative manpower to 
duplicate what this single machine provides far far out paces its costs 
for me.
The same, I feel, can be applied to the cost of a synthesizer that gives 
you clear, consistent speech across platforms, requiring no configuration, 
regardless of operating system.
so, speaking personally, the answer is no. I would rather invest in a unit 
that  provides quality, then a cli tool that does not..even if free.

Best,
Kare
