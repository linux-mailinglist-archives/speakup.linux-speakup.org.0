X-Bogosity: Ham, tests=bogofilter, spamicity=0.000000, version=1.2.5

So, I am going to make a folder with the espeak tar.xz and the espeak-ng 
tar.gz files in it, and I can write a script to do the typing part.
The two files are:
espeak-ng_1.49.2+dfsg-8+deb10u1.debian.tar.xz
and
espeakup_0.80.orig.tar.gz

So is there a command I can put in a script that will run the installer from 
the tar.gz files, or do I need to write in the tar -xv filename stuff, and 
then know the folder name to install from?
Thanks for any help.

Glenn

Well, you could try Debian or maybe Lubuntu instead.

Cheers,
