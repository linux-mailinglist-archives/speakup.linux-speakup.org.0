I sent a speech synthesizer to a friend and may have sent him a disk with
provox on it and a dos system.
If I didn't he's going to have a real hard time getting that litetalk
synthesizer talking.
Has anyone got a copy of the provox 7.50 software and documentation you
could share with me so just in case provox isn't on those two floppy disks
we can stack the deck?
My friend wants to play some old games on his dos box and given his
medical condition isn't likely to survive into 2021.
