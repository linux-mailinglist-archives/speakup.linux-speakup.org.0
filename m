I may be able to do that, but of course I pressed enter, that is how I knew 
the next page was the language selection, using SeeingAI.
When I'm done with setting up the computer, I can boot to the SD card again 
and have someone take a picture over face time.
To whom would I send the pict to?
Glenn

That's odd. Where you also typing enter after pressing s?

Would you be able to take a photograph of the screen there, so we can
know exactly how the boot menu is showing up?
