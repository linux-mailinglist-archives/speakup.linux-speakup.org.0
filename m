Yeah, that is what I was using, it is CD size, not DVD size.
It was around 400 MB in size.
I was thinking it would be much smaller.
Maybe I need the first of the DVD installs.
But when I did that before, like a year or so ago, it did not set up my =
sources.list file, and I had to find the repositories and put them in =
myself.

  I suggest you try the netinst with additional firmware. If you google, =
you'll find it.

      Unless I am sadly mistaken, the only Debian distro with speech is =
the full installer, Disk #1. I didn't know that 11.7 was out in =
distributed form, only upgradable from 11.6, which I just did the other =
day successfully.

                Howdy All,
        I am not having luck with getting the Debian installer to speak.
        I am booting to:
        debian-11.7.0-i386-netinst.iso
        from:
        https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/
        and I have tried alt S, S alone, and down arrowing 5 times and =
enter, and down arrowing 4 times and enter.
        These are things I read that are supposed to put it into a =
talking installer.
        Does this version not have a talking installer?
        I asked on the Debian accessibility list, but I have gotten no =
responses, so I thought I'd ask here.
        I'll use speakup on it in a CLI, if I can get it working.

        Thanks.

        Glenn
