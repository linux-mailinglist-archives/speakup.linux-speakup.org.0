     No matter if you like NFB or not, they were correct in the need to 
have independent screenreader options.  Hundreds if not thousands of 
blind people forced to use Windows by their employer would be out of a 
job if JAWS did not exist.  Narrator still doesn't have anything close 
to the functionality or scripting capabilities of JAWS or NVDA.
