This is not about the latest greatest, it’s just that running GUI is
non-issue these days.  Several years ago, I had to decommission an
almost 20 years old computer with 256 GB RAM used by my mother in law
not because it couldn’t run a GUI but because displaying certain web
sites in a web browser was really non-comfortable (which is the real and
hard to avoid bottleneck).  And guess what I did?  I replaced the
computer with another junk >10 years old computer with 2 GB RAM and the
problem was solved.  No climate impact, no supply chain problems, just a
positive effect of freeing up a bit storage space :-).

Milan
