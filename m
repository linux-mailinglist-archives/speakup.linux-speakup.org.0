Oh..let's help this soul.
First, can you share in greater detail your lynx setup?
I ask this because the lynx cookies file name must be set at the config 
level.
As for duckduckgo, I am wondering where you are based int he world?
I ask this because, at least in North America, duckduckgo does not present 
image captcha in my experience.
