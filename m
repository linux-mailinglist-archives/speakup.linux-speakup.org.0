Hi folks,
When I asked about this in  the summer, I had not as of yet gotten my new 
computer built.
Now that it is done, including a slot for the longer older dectalk 
internal card
I am seeking that older software.  the dectalk pc software provided is not 
the correct item.

Anyone have a copy?
Thanks,
Karen
