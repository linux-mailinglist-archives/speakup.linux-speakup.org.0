Hi folks,
seasoning my question this time is the  fact that in March, most major 
email pockets, Apple, Google, Yahoo, all started requiring email addresses 
to  carry an   identifying code that matches the actual  host, you 
@you.com 
has a code insuring that the email is coming from a place called you.com
Goal is to keep spam from using hosts as a cover.
Mailing list locations like freelist.org are requiring it too.
This matters, because for reasons that are unclear, Luke Davis who  owns 
shellworld, either cannot, I have heard his mom is ill, or chooses not, to 
take the needed steps to properly insure  shellworld has these 
identifiers..and for me its becoming quite a problem.
I have staff who use gmail, often sending content here so I  can use the 
Ubuntu Linux shell tools here for work..but they are not getting through.
I cannot post to freelist locations, bookshare is hosted there  among 
other lists.
So, seeking an email solution to add to my addresses for places like 
freelist and  where associates can safely write me.
Do not want to abandon my shellworld address all together for many 
reasons, just add a new one.

  Happy to document the email requirement if of interest.
Any prospects?
thanks,
Karen
