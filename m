Hi, as far as I know, the archives haven't been preserved unfortunately. 
Last year, I contacted Kirk privately and he told me so, then I simply 
set the list for me to start receiving individual messages instead of 
vacation mode. I've done a quick search here, and it appears I have 
deleted your thread already, otherwise perhaps I could retrieve the 
answer you need.

Sorry for not being able to help.
Regards,
Cleverson
