Okay, this time I typed in voxin, and after, or before, I entered alsa, and 
it still didn't work.
I will try ibmtts and alsa and see what it does.
Thanks

OK, Glen, let me explain again, a couple of things. First, when you run
spd-conf  you must type in voxin, even though it will ask you to correct 
your
answer. 2nd select alsa which at least in my case works better. I am 
thinking a
live phone call might be better than all these back-and-forth messaging, but
first try those steps. Good luck
