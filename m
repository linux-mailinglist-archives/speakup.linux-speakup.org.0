We employed the majority of the people looking for work in my district.
Nebraska nation-wide, is one of the best in job placement.
In fact, we often got moneys from other states that did not do as well as 
us.
When an agency does not spend all their moneys from the Federal government, 
they have to give it back, and it would then go to the states that do well 
in job placement.
