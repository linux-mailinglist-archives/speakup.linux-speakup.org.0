Hi All: In Debian on my laptop, I have been running voxin, however, lately an 
anoying accurance. After arrowing down, I hear what sounds like 2 Eliquence 
voices, 1 briefing reading from a line above. Well, when I asked Gilles, he 
suggests I try "spd-say" However, it doesn't seem to work. Please inform where 
or how to enable this, or if you agree, it will fix the double reading. Thanks 
so much in advance
Chime
