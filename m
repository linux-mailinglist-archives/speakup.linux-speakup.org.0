In my work, the client got what ever they needed.
We never forced Windows or Jaws on them.

And how often do clients get a choice about their tools?
Support this with objective documentation, as this is your professional
industry, if memory serves.
I recall on more than one occasion being provided with documentation where
jaws was the only screen reader choice a client was given.
Know of at least one professional who turned to Linux because they never
wanted to use Jaws or windows again.
since rehab holds the money strings for fs, it is up to the counselors to
prove, with numbers, that it is worth  the financial investment  for
freedom scientific.
My understanding is that nvda came into being because clients wanted more
choices  than Jaws, and counselors were resistant.
