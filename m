Chime,
granted I am not using speakup, but it seems there is a speakup-key, think 
of the voiceover, or vo key on the mac, which  when combined with another 
key, here 5, produces an effect tied to the  screen reader in question.
My personal experience is that  it mirrors the hotkey concept from what 
you might recall from vocal eyes.
Speaking personally? most  screen reader programs  I have used over the 
decades include  a way to set this pronunciation  option  as a 
configuration.
Well they do both,  have a hot key for it like you illustrate,  and a way 
to turn on letters spoken phonetically i. e. echo tango charlie all the 
time.
Having to stop and do something special, instead of say just move your 
left  or right arrow key over the  letters in question seems kind 
of...well inefficient.
That is me though,
Kare
