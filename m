Hi again,
As I am having trouble getting Voxin to install into my Debian in the CLI, 
for use with Speakup, I've been searching on-line, and I see a page for 
speech-dispatcher-voxin
at:
https://debian.pkgs.org/11/debian-contrib-amd64/speech-dispatcher-voxin_0.10.2-2_amd64.deb.html
but it is only for 64 bit.
My version of Debian is:
VERSION="11 (bullseye)"
It is on an older  netbook computer.
I tried putting the /etc/speech-dispatcher directory into /etc/default, but 
that did not help.
I sure hope someone has some ideas to get Voxin working.
Thanks for any help.

Glenn
