Chime,
voiceover for the mac has this keystroke.
Business vision has this keystroke.

and  yes, for the short time I played with vocal eyes during the pandemic, 
it has it too.
Sometimes the control key is used, sometimes the alt key is used, and 
sometimes you can set a hot key for it.
The ability to pause speech can be as important as the ability to start 
it, if that makes sense.
