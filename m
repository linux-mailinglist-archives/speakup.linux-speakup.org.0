When userland echoes 8bit characters to /dev/synth with e.g.

echo -e '\xe9' > /dev/synth

synth_write would get characters beyond 0x7f, and thus negative when
char is signed.  When given to synth_buffer_add which takes a u16, this
would sign-extend and produce a U+ffxy character rather than U+xy.
Users thus get garbled text instead of accents in their output.

Let's fix this by making sure that we read unsigned characters.
