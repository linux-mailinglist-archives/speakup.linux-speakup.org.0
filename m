Well espeak is espeak, no matter what flavor of Linux it's on, Linux is 
Linux.
I imagined the only differences between distros would be it's location.
And I do appreciate it when people give a real answer, rather than just 
directing me where to look it up.
Or is help only reserved for those who strive to make Linux their main 
source of computing?

Hello,

answer in line.

It would have been a fair question if asked in the right list, BUT this one 
if
primarily about the speakup kernel driver, rather than software that make 
use of
it, like speakup or speechd-up.

Further you should have stated which distribution you are using and if you 
were
using espeakup or speechd-up, which would have allowed to give you an 
adapted
answer.

You can learn how to ask questions the smart way reading this:

Is that how grateful you are for people who spend their time, of which they 
have
already not enough to do all they need to, to try to help you?

Again, only if the question is properly asked and in the right channel, see 
above.

What? Nobody suggested you google anything, just to read the documentation
provided with your software, in this case at least using the "man" utility
installed in your system.

This very unfair statement convince me that we were wrong wasting our time
trying to help you. I won't do this mistake again.

Good luck,
Didier
