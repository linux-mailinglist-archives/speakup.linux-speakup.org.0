Anyone here use gMail with Alpine and experience any issues with the new 
gMail two step verification and gMail blocking apps they consider unsecure?
Google just started blocking some clients, and it isn't fixable through 
gMail settings any more.

Hi All: The nice thing in Alpine, you can configure it to click on urls in 
an
e-mail. As far as any atatchments which you would receive, you would hit a v
and look over any which you can save.
