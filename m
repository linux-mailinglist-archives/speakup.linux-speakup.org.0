Hi all,
  owning this is off topic, given the far more knowledgeable and I would 
imagine likely more emotionally grounded  Linux folks here, I am sending 
out   a request I have circulated elsewhere as well.
Elsewhere includes the Blinux, Debian, and alpine lists.
Please if you can support here, get in touch.
Thanks,
Kare

Sharing what I posted to alpine  as well as here..My resource is    doing all 
they can, but I truly am not equips to help them..please someone who knows what 
they are doing first hand get in touch?



Currently uses alpine to access their gmail account.
A bit of context
I experience sight loss, with basic html my only direct access to my gmail 
account..which has been removed as of last Monday.
I use my gmail account personally and professionally, its lost is quite quite 
quite a situation for me.
There is an associate in Toronto who is aiming to provide an email setup, 
configuring alpine to access gmail, but he has never configured alpine before.
As I experience sight loss, and have only accessed my gmail account via the web 
interface, I  need to
1, be sure what I am told should happen here incorporating imap is what I 
expect,
and 2, insure my associate has correct information, all of my alpine access is 
via dreamhost, and they do not configure alpine well.
My associate is using Alpine 2.5, which I recall has a tool that allows one to 
authenticate to gmail,  but I am seeking someone with direct experience so this 
gets done  to the best of Alpine's ability.
If you are personally doing this, Can you please write me off list?
I absolutely positively do not have the emotional capacity to gamble here, 
hoping to connect Ron with someone who knows what they are doing.

Kare
