I don't have a copy of 7.50, but online there are:

6.71: http://www.nfbnet.org/files/blind/PRVX671B.ZIP
6.6: http://www.nfbnet.org/files/blind/PROVOX66.ZIP

7.05: http://web.archive.org/web/20011218024750/http://www.mhonline.net/~chuckh/prvx705b.zip
7.05 sources: http://web.archive.org/web/20011218024750/http://www.mhonline.net/~chuckh/prvx705s.zip

7.xx: http://web.archive.org/web/20150310023429/http://www.hallenbeck.ftml.net/provox7.zip

'7.xx' is identical to extracting both 7.05 zips but with more files
