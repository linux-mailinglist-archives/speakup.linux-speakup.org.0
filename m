Hi chime,
not only phone support, but  in person as well.
My first screen reader / synthesizer combination in the late 80s came with 
in  person training.
For a while in the mid 90s I provided this service when I worked for Xerox 
adaptive Technology.  traveling to places, sitting down with new computer 
users,  and  helping them learn what they personally needed to  move 
forward.
That personal touch, speaking personally, made the price worth it in the 
end.
I certainly had my share of thankful clients.
Kare
