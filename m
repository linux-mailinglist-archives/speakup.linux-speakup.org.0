When I asked Jackie McBride who runs the midimag list hosted on freelists 
the problem back on February 29, she shared the below explanation.
What happens is that a service states in the error email that it cannot 
find  my hostname.
Luke uses some odd thing that I believe is a part of comcast business, 
unless  he has changed to another service.
Here is the explanation.  And no Pannex was far from accommodating when I 
considered using them a  while back.


2nd, part of the problem is that Google, Yahoo, MS, Apple--indeed,
all the big email players--are, as of 24 Feb., rejecting emails that
don't have DMARC records associated w/their domains, & shellworld
fits into that category. Is Shellworld owned by Luke? If so, then u
should mention this to him, & I can also, as well as offering
assistance in setting up those records, if that would be something of
interest to him.

If the folks at Shellworld won't set up these email authentication
records, then I fear your only other alternative is to get another
email address from a provider that has these records in place. It
really is best practice. I personally have had them in place for all
my clients for quite a few years now. But, in an attempt to decrease
(& hopefully stop) the vast amounts of very costly phishing & spam
emails being sent, email providers have banded together & basically
said "if domains don't have records to prove their identity, we're
not sending their emails". That came into effect on Feb. 24.
