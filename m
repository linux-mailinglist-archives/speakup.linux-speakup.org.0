Hi.  So, I have had two instances in the last few weeks where the
insert key remains on, fooling with the insert,shift keys does
nothing.  Only solution seems to be a reboot.  I am using kernel
6.1.82 -- with gentoo patches.  Is there a flag somewhere I can
toggle?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
