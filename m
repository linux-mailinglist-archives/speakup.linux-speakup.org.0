Well technically freedom scientific does not exist any longer, being bought=

Still, I can respect why they, or nvda have not created their tools for=20

That is because as I understand it, Linux is  quite like clay. You can=20
mold a distribution into almost anything. there are various=20
personifications of the system, all sorts of ways and changes and options=

for creativity.
however adaptive tools are often extensions of physical characteristics,=20
hands, eyes, ears, brains, combinations of these.
To build solid assistive tools one must have a solid  foundation as it=20
were.  that is part of why there have needed to be so few Apple  efforts at=
=20
inclusion, they  created  with, and then created in-house adaptive tools=20
for various  populations that were built into the system.
Although Microsoft did not bother until much later, in theory at least, the=
=20
consistency of windows is what makes it possible for freedom or the former=
=20
gw  micro or nvda to create something that can in theory  work.
Floor for the furniture is somewhat solid.
Just my thoughts,
