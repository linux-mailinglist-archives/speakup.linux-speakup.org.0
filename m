I finally got it talking, but the strange issue I'm having is that I get =
through the language, location and keyboard, and then it does not find =
the installation media.
I was never prompted for the WIFI, and I know it works, because I boot =
to an SD card on this computer, and I had Debian on that card.
I'm trying to get an install without a desktop.
So I wonder if I need to go with the full DVD installer, if it is =
available.

  Unless I am sadly mistaken, the only Debian distro with speech is the =
full installer, Disk #1. I didn't know that 11.7 was out in distributed =
form, only upgradable from 11.6, which I just did the other day =
successfully.

            Howdy All,
    I am not having luck with getting the Debian installer to speak.
    I am booting to:
    debian-11.7.0-i386-netinst.iso
    from:
    https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/
    and I have tried alt S, S alone, and down arrowing 5 times and =
enter, and down arrowing 4 times and enter.
    These are things I read that are supposed to put it into a talking =
installer.
    Does this version not have a talking installer?
    I asked on the Debian accessibility list, but I have gotten no =
responses, so I thought I'd ask here.
    I'll use speakup on it in a CLI, if I can get it working.

    Thanks.

    Glenn
