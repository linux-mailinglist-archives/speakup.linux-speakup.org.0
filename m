One of the truly valuable things about John's point about Linux working=20
on everything is this.
There are parts of the world where getting allot of adaptive technology is=
=20
quite impossible, let alone the hot off the store shelf machines.
A person can take an older laptop, install Linux, and transform their=20
life.
Not to mention what those in Linux users groups learn and carry forward.
for a time in Toronto we had a group that would take older donated=20
laptops, put Linux on them, and give those machines to newcomers.=20
suddenly  a person had the means to learn English, look for a job, perhaps=
=20
even do that  Job..with little cost to them.
I may not use Linux personally, but I  know first hand that Linux is a=20
community builder, and a bridge for allot of people.
