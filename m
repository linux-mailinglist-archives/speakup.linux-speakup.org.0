SpeakUping of Slint,
Can this be installed onto a flash drive with Universal USB Installer rather than Rufus?
That is how I usually install Linux and other distros.
Thanks.

Hello Jude,

I highly recommend reading PulseAudio under the hood from Victor Gaydov:
https://gavv.github.io/articles/pulseaudio-under-the-hood/

It is not in the "official" documentation but provides a very in depth
information while staying practical and understandable by the casual users
like me. I just hope that would exist a similar document about ALSA.

My position is that if properly configured it should not mess up anything.

I can't remember a complaint I would have received about PulseAudio
from Slint users - Including yourself <smile>. Maybe I forgot?

Best, Didier
