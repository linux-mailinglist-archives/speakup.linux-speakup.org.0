  Hi folks,

Gentlemen,
Inserting an explanation about inflection, at least as applied to the 
dectalk.
Inflection is what provides a more human expression when text is read. 
For example
  the decktalk will still use a voice reflecting that a question has been 
asked even if punctuation is turned off.  will shout at the presence of an 
exclamation mark etc.

Granted Speaking personally this entire exchange supports chime's stance 
that speakup must be used by programmers, but there*must* be something 
uniform that allows rate, pitch, inflection, presence or absence of spoken 
caps, presence or absence of curtain punctuation marks, etc., available for 
*the user* to set and have those remain  constant, not to change at the 
whims of speakup. if that is not happening, you have problems.
as for people falling  into chime's configuration trap, keep in mind that 
even Linux has little  solid consistent guides.  To assume that someone is 
not going to have to experiment.
Such is why  speaking personally, there should be guides both for Linux 
itself and speakup outside of  the operating system, not the howtos that 
load from within the system.
Inflection is what makes a synthesizer sound human and clear and 
understandable.

Think Stephen Hawking  as an example.
Likewise consider that someone new to speech *must* be able to understand 
what is spoken, based on human interaction, which includes inflection.
If speakup lacks the option  after being around  for so long, no wonder 
few testing for accessibility even bother with Linux at all.


Karen
