Adding something important, if slightly different, to this discussion.
speaking personally, I feel it is absolutely critical to raise the Linux=20
profile generally among accessibility discussions if you desire anyone=20
outside of your personal computer use to understand your needs and take=20
you seriously.
That means articles with the a11y project, making sure that webaim=20
includes Linux when doing surveys..something that they did not last time I=
=20
checked because they felt the population is too small.
Personally, that makes me  more than a bit angry, because a disability=20
experience is  only  one person at a time regardless, and there is a major=
=20
difference between compliance, and inclusion of those individual=20
experiences.
Preaching to the choir i. e. only to the impacted population, is not going=
=20
to  result in broader understanding from those involved with major=20
distributions, nor those seeking information on inclusion from outside of=
=20
the experience.
Until Linux is considered to be more than just a programmers hobby,=20
getting elements effortlessly incorporated may be a challenge.
