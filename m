I do use Be My Eyes often, but I can tell the volunteers aren't fond of 
being a screenreader.
But I've used them for that when I'm in a multiple choice option window, 
like grub or something.
So yeah, I make that my last screenreader option.
Once in a while you get a techie sort who doesn't mind though.
One lady said she was a tech, so she was able to decipher the hieroglyphs on 
the F-keys so I could make sure the volume was up on a laptop.
