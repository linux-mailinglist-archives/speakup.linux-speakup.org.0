	hello.   Perhaps you're thinking of Artic Business vision, which was a synthesizer and a
screen reader in the 80's.  I used the Artic synthesizer in my Toshiba T1200 laptop for many
many years along with Flipper as the screen reader.  I still have that machine, though I've not
fired it up in decades; it served me from 1988 through 2004 or 2005, which was a good run.

-thanks
-Brian
