Hi Jookia,

I'm not sure if the command line is more accessible. For me, it is=20
preferable.

My first computer ran dos and then I used unix at university. I found=20
windows 3.1 and windows 95 very frustrating with early windows screen=20
readers, so I used linux at home and found I could do mostly everything I=
=20
wanted.

I am a linux system administrator and I was able to use linux at my job. I=
=20
eventually switched jobs and I can no longer use a linux desktop, so I've=
=20
adapted to windows. I still do most of my work in a linux shell, albeit,=20
using jaws which is far from ideal.

for personal use, I mainly use an iphone. In terms of accessibility, I=20
find it to be the most accessible platform.  I hardly used linux at home=20
the past 5 years or so as I transitioned to the iphone. I mainly used it=20
for email, since it is far easier to type on a keyboard, and connecting a=
=20
keyboard to the iphone is a hassle.

Lately, as I've been using AI more, I've found myself using linux more and=
=20
more.

I'm still more comfortable in linux than windows, but I really like the=20
touch interface of the iphone. I initially used android, so I could get a=
=20
shell on the phone and play around, but I was given an iphone at work and=
=20
found voiceover to be far superior to talkback.

I recently upgraded my pc and it was a challenge to get speakup working. I=
=20
first tried a usb serial port and eventually got it working with a pci=20
serial card.

I'm greatful to Kirk for developing speakup and Samuel for maintaining it=
=20
and all of those who have contributed to it. I loved it from the first=20
time I used it, primarily because I used the ASAP dos screen reader before=
=20
that, and speakup is very similar. I change the numpad layout on jaws to=20
be like speakup so it is easier to switch back and forth when at work and=
=20
home, but lately I do find myself doing capslock+p and capslock+semicolon=
=20
a lot using speakup. :P
