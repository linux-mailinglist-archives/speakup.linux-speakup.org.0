Actually, what you  are thinking is correct, a key to stop the blabbering, 
<love that term> and start it again.
granted I am no Linux user, but I have personally never encountered 
synthesis that could not be paused.  It is the task of the screen reader to 
create drivers or config files if you will insuring various speech options 
are controlled by your program.
Chime, have you tried the control  key on your voice?  Might need to hold 
it down 
if she has built up a full head of steam laughs.
You  Know how some women get when they start talking.
