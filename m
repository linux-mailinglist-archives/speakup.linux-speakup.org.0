Sorry, did not answer this previously.
One benefit of Linux users groups, even if one, like myself, cannot use 
Linux, is that individuals with long histories building computers  enjoy 
the challenge.
They also tend to attract interest, from engineers and the like working in 
other systems.  Where I am in Ontario we have a few such lists...given how 
important  my hardware is for me, I do my homework smiles.

p. s. I am using the dectalk internal card to write this message..still 
need to fix the cD Rom drive conflict though.
