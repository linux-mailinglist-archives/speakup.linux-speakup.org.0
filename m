While I cannot answer Karens question, I can say that many times, listening to L 
Y N X in an options or drop down list, is not always easy. Sometimes options are 
jumbled or hard to pick out. Almost sounds as if an x gets added to many items. 
Obviously I have never been a fan of these sorts of drop down menus.
