But I just now installed speechd-up and it installed, and now it is talking.
Not Voxin, but at least it is talking.

Hi Greg,
I got a message yesterday, or the day before, I think it was on another
list, about my Voxin installation issue, and the reply stated:
According to https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/python3-speechd
spd-conf is provided in the package python3-speechd.


I'm not sure any more, but Maybe I got this because speechd-up was not in
the Debian repository.
Glenn

It should. Install speechd-up, and that will interface speakup to
speech-dispatcher. That will in turn use whatever speech-dispatcher is
configured to use.

apt install espeakup

That will use espeak directly, without requiring speech-dispatcher.
