speaking personally?
I am confused that this feature even needs requesting.
Every single DOS screen reader I own has  a setting where the user decides 
how numbers are spoken.  single digits or words.
Further speaking personally I feel separating the idea, text to speech, 
instead of drivers written to enhance synthesizer  quality abilities leads 
to this problem too.
Pronunciation's  in text to speech only tools is a fine example.
Present and present are announced based on context,   dessert and desert 
those sorts of things, largely because my screen reader programs draw about 
the capabilities of the synthesizer source I am using.
What frustrates me  about muddying how such technology works is  the way 
outsiders respond when a situation arises.
Speakup is less than a quality screen reader if it does not easily provide 
a way for an individual to set rate, pitch, inflection, number 
pronunciation's,   symbols anagrams and so forth.
I recently had someone from my senator's office tell met hat an embedded 
form was supposed to work with screen readers..as if all of them are the 
same work the same, and interact the same regardless of platform.  Never 
mind that the embedded nature meant the form would not appear..which I 
demonstrated.
If Linux in general is going to be taken seriously, speaking personally, 
and Speakup in particular is to be considered a solid tool?
these features need to be present.
text to speech is just what it says a spoken rendition of a plain text 
file, which is why the pronunciation can be so dreadful.  It takes a 
quality screen reader program to provide  all the extras, mixing the 
terms only leads to poor results.
Best,
Karen
