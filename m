I did an exhaustive search on-line, and found:
speakupconf
So speakup load

  Subject: volume set in speakup


  Hi Group,
  In a VM I have Ubuntu Server running, and I just now went in to update =
it, since I haven't used it in a while.
  I'm using speakup in there, and I guess I never got around to lowering =
the volume, it is quite loud.
  I did insert + 2 I think it was to lower it for now, but I want to =
make it permanent.
  I looked in /etc/speakup for a settings file, but didn't notice =
anything relevant.
  Do I have to change this in speechd.conf?
  Thanks.
