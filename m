Hi Chime,
Now this is interesting.
You may recall that the ip address for shellworld often produces 
rejections of sites you can yourself reach in lynx.
When I follow your dogpile link I am presented with a p lease turn on 
JavaScript and cookies message, cloudflare actually.
works nicely in l i n k s, although I will need to tighten my search 
questions some.

Karen
