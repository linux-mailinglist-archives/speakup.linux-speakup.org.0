because speaking personally, there are times in different settings, when 
one   desires the flexibility of adjusting how much or how little 
inflection is provided..without having to be a computer programmer and edit 
that way.
Its about choices allowing for one to  make use of the screen reading tool 
individually.
But again, I am not an actual user.  those choosing the tool might not 
care.  Still, speaking personally, the lack of flexibility without 
complexity would deter my considering the program, which is a shame since 
it may be the only Linux option for hardware speech.
