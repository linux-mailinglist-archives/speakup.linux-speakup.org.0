It is possible to tell the list software to send you a copy of a
message. To do that, you would have to know the number of the message
since the list manager mlmmj started being used to run this
list. Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to get a message
number/subject index as far as I can tell. For info, send a blank
message to:
speakup+help@linux-speakup.org
