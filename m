Hi All,
It was operator error.
My system wasn't booting to my USB media, and when I did the actions to =
select a boot drive, I got it to work with S and enter.
Thanks.

  Subject: Debian Install With Speech


          Howdy All,
  I am not having luck with getting the Debian installer to speak.
  I am booting to:
  debian-11.7.0-i386-netinst.iso
  from:
  https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/
  and I have tried alt S, S alone, and down arrowing 5 times and enter, =
and down arrowing 4 times and enter.
  These are things I read that are supposed to put it into a talking =
installer.
  Does this version not have a talking installer?
  I asked on the Debian accessibility list, but I have gotten no =
responses, so I thought I'd ask here.
  I'll use speakup on it in a CLI, if I can get it working.

  Thanks.

  Glenn
