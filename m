I've never had a problem, I didn't mean it that way.
You can tell in a person's lack of enthusiasm sometimes.
Like if I get a gal to read my Ham radio display, where usually a guy thinks 
it's awesome.
Not to be sexist, just generalizing here.
I've never had a rude person, they do it I think because they want to help 
others.

It's best to tell the volunteer you need screen reading and what they tell
you has a near certainty to help even though they may not understand what
they're reading.  Every time I've needed be my eyes to do screen reading
the information they gave me helped and I gave them a good rating for that
effort.
