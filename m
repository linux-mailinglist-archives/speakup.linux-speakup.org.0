John,
You commented that outspoken was unusable prior to 2005.
I commented that I have use for it today 20 years later.
Instead of simply recognizing two people with different experiences, you=20
say well some folks  ride to la on horseback..as if somehow my personal=20
productivity can fit your experience.  That somehow  my unique situation=20
means I am doing things behind the times...to what end?
you state that I need not comment on everything you spout here..I do not.
For example when you said  You did not personally feel anyone was building=
=20
hardware synthesizers any more, I remained silent.
i did not reference a Canadian company doing so, nor did I reference new=20
scripting efforts  to use the Raspberry pi for the hardware synthesizer.
We may share to the slightest degree a label, but by no means is our=20
experience the same..I have no issue with more than one solution.
You, however, talk about the blindness population as a single unite with=20
no human  uniqueness or choice.
Indeed, I cannot use most of your tools for medical reasons..but I could=20
just as likely just choose a different way to accommodate.
In your world that is a problem, in mine it is not.
