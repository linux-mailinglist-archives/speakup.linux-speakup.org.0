Karen,
Most employers don't want NVDA, and will only allow Jaws.
In Nebraska, if an employer said put on whatever works, the counselors will 
use NVDA, because of the cost of Jaws.
If some of the clients in a call center already use Jaws, but don't know 
NVDA, the counselor will use Jaws, because the other clients will need to 
learn one of the two.
So it's all choice, but in the workplace, it depends on what the employer 
will allow.
Also, sometimes scripts need to be made, and there are more Jaws scripters 
available than there are NVDA add-on writers.
So this perception that Jaws is forced by rehab, from my 31 years in the 
business I can say is rubbish.
Now, if a counselor did not know how to use NVDA, and either may be chosen, 
the rehab counselor is able to select the one that the counselor feels is 
best for the student and for the counselor's teaching.
When it comes to part B moneys, which is used for non-vocational purchases, 
where a lot of Jaws purchases come from, it is in the agency's best interest 
to spend as little as possible, because that doesn't come back like VR 
expenditures do.
Glenn

The challenge with that example is that, as one often gets reminded,  the
rehab systems track record for facilitating  employment for their clients
is quite poor.
With a high percentage of unemployment among our clients.  Making,
speaking personally, your buying Jaws for personal use not really
reflecting how the system would respond to an alternative request.
Now if someone from organized rehab said, okay freedom scientific, we are
creating an employment program where our clients will train in Linux,
needing a solid screen reader solution for the system.  We will give you an
exclusive development contract for s millions to create the tool.
Fs would likely say where do we sign?
