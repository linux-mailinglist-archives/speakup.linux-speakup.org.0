Hi Greg: Samuel listed some tests, but it didn't seem obvious how to type them.
I went looking through my DecTalk mp3s for an example of an affect I am looking 
for. I certainly didn't create this, but in the following audio, please pay 
attention to the phrase "in the good old dos days"
http://www.hubert-humphrey.com/dt43sample.mp3
Alot of the other files were skits-and-lots of DecTalk songs. Thanks for 
listening
Chime
