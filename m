Hi All: A majority of the time I keep an option as "cursoring on" however, as an 
example, alsamixer works a bit better in hightlight tracking. 1 of our Linux 
experts is trying to write me a Podcast client, however, in "kersoring" it says 
nothing while arrowing. Would their be something simple to tell Speakup to 
switch to this other mode? Sort of like writing set files in Vocal-Eyes for a 
specific application? Thanks so much in advance-and-will be back with another 
inquiree
Chime
