While this certainly supports claims  that the   rehab system provided Jaws=
=20
and nothing else, my greater concern is this.
consider the number of say DOS screen readers which existed, from screen=20
power to vocal eyes,  from asap to business vision  and so forth.
supported by a vast array of synthesis choices as well.
  In the windows arena there was jaws, but also windows bridge,  the Hal=20
products, wind-vision,  and of=20
course window eyes until=20
freedom  scientific took over variety options.
Why did not the NfB use its funding and influence to  secure innovator=20
funding,  allowing many independent screen reader developers to keep=20
choices for=20
the windows market?
Instead of say fighting the acb, or using their influence to monopolize=20
the rehab system for jaws Alone, or deciding if a group did not want to=20
dance  to their tune  they would   ostrasize people etc.?
You talk about=20
apple as if they were being=20
restrictive, when they worked with screen reader talent  from the start.


Prior to voiceover there was outspoken, I still have a mac running it,=20
with apple working  along side the outspoken developers, first for their=20
product, and then  to create=20
voiceover.
further, I understand that  the  mac terminal allows users to access other=
=20
screen readers as well.
to say people would be out of a job without Jaws is only  true if Jaws was=
=20
the only option  discussed.
after all, NfB as an organization existed  long before Microsoft, what was=
=20
it about them, claiming they represented everyone experiencing sight loss=
=20
that Microsoft did not want to work with  long before narrator?
I imagine allot of it was tied to the NFB and their cult like reputation,=
=20
speaking personally.
