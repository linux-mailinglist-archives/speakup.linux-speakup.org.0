This is a fine example of why, speaking profoundly personally, the 
suggestion   of how a person's physical experience must automatically be a 
disability is frankly poor understanding.
The associate here, has never seen a card with such jumpers, finding the 
switches a bit scary.
you on the other hand just changed them around.
I doubt the irq options you list are correct, 5 is for sound cards, 7 for 
printers, 3 a part of the 2/4 unit com port wise.
My point though is the generalization that because you find something 
simple others should makes little personal sense.
I find baking bread from scratch quite simple.  One of my sisters burns 
boiling  water smiles.
