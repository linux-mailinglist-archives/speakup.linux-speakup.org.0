And as I said from the outset, I am far more concerned with how this=20
article   makes accessibility, and Red Hat commitment to accessibility=20
appear  to the public.
A claim to having authority, when stating one knows nothing about how=20
access can be provided to various populations equally deserving is=20
concerning.
even in the article comments an individual outlined a need, that they did=
=20
not anticipate being met because Fedora was creating a "blindness"=20
program.
If your associate  leads with stated limits,  yet does not  indicate he=20
plans to address them, inclusion on this platform for all who seek it=20
seems  far from likely.
I do agree on the forum though. Had comment snot been closed by the time I=
=20
got  the article, and I been  in a position to do so, I might have  raised=
=20
them  on the spot.
