Glen,
I have no reason to  follow up on anything.  The role of a commission, and=
=20
the duty of a rehab system employee are  two different things.
that you state you work for a  nfb philosophy rehab office speaks volumes=
=20
for your integrity.
clearly your staff simply tell this commission what they want to hear, or=
=20
they exist in name only.
nothing changes your description of your state.
