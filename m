Glenn,
let me see.
The NFB once tried to get  New York state to stop providing services to=20
individuals using   service animals.
For a time you could not get services there if  using paratransit.
In the state of Wisconsin a blind child drowned at a NFB summer camp,=20
because the teacher thought  they were providing Nfb philosophy swimming=20
training...no suite from the blind parents, their kid died for the NfB=20
cause.
And from my personal experience, because of  both Nfb stance and other=20
perspectives  after I was accepted into Georgetown law school and catholic=
=20
University school of law, the state of Arkansas would not buy me a=20
computer....at all.
And of course there are the cult like practices at Nfb training centers=20
where individuals are expected to cut off ties with their families, are=20
forced to become blind by the organizations definition, and discouraged=20
from even using  sighted help when shopping unless the help is paid.
do not ever suggest that the NfB  philosophy has provided anything=20
uniformly  respectable for anyone.
Oh, the labor laws they violate in the state of Maryland...the more I=20
write the more examples I  can recall.
Lord when I worked for Xerox, it was the newly blinded I would meet being=
=20
told they were not good blind people if their canes looked different by=20
Nfb standards
