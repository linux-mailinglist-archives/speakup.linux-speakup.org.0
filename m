Speaking very personally the issue with ebrowse for links the chain 
users, elinks users and lynx users is this.
Edbrowse does not present clearly the items on a page.
Instead, one must use several commands to get a sense of your options, 
which  again speaking personally is both very confusing and time 
consuming.
I know some folks love it, but the layers between the end user and 
information seem needlessly complex.
