Hi All,
  Sharing this information here for a few reasons.
mostly because of the creative approaches many here have to access 
technology, approaches I feel, speaking personally, are worthy of 
investment.
The grant is  for $50k, and is world wide.
Speaking personally, perhaps a fine way to raise the command line with a 
blending of true progress enhancement, allowing for individualized 
customizing of tools.
thoughts?

Subject: Seeking accessibility startups for ATS's biggest year yet
I'm happy to share that applications for Access to Success's biggest year
are now open! The 2025 cohort features 5x the funding available ($10k last
year > > $50k this year), new partnerships for our startups (Toyota Mobility
Foundation, University Health Network), and even more benefits being added
every week.

I would be grateful if you could help us get the word out to startups in
your network working on mobility, hearing, vision, cognition,
neurodiversity, aging, rehabilitation and other disability-related areas.
You are welcome to share our LinkedIn post or use the sample caption below:

Our friends at @Access to Success Organization are seeking startups building
life-changing innovations for people with disabilities. Their free, 3-month
virtual accelerator will provide tailor-made programming, a global network
of experts, and $50,000 in funding.

ATS is open to worldwide startups addressing challenges in mobility,
hearing, vision, cognition, neurodiversity, aging, rehabilitation and other
disability-related areas. If that's you, up for their info session on May
16: https://events.humanitix.com/ats-2025-info-session

In the meantime, if there's anything at all I can do to help, please don't
hesitate to let me know!

Thanks,
Varun
