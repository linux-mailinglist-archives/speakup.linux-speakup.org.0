I want to get my old Asus Epc 701 with 2 GB of RAM going, hopefully to put 
some Ham software on it.
It used to use XP.
I wanted to try the talking Arch I downloaded, but it cannot boot that 
kernel, and I didn't know where an older one is.
I tried Puppy Linux, but that had problems too, so I found AntiX.
It seems to work well, and if it were talking, I could see how I like it.
I don't know if the limited repository would eventually be a turn off.
Glenn

Howdy,

Well i didnt follow the thread very close and already deleted most parts of 
it, but an idea could be booting an accessible live system and chmod or 
similar into it to configure it.

Just for my own interes: whats the reason to use it if there is no basic way 
by default for you to interact with that system? Any specific stuff it 
provides? Or any functionality?

Cheers chrys
