Hi Greg-and-All: Other than the U S B support, many times I mentioned about the 
rate, pitch, and volume constantly dropping, to where I had to alter each of 
those options up-and-down so it was back to my liking. And yes, running a script 
to add more inflection would get knocked out once these other settings dropped.
Your willingness to help in the way you did was quite a bit appreciated as it 
probably took us in to a valuable dialogue.
Chime
