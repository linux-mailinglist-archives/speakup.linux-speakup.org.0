thinkpenguin.com knows nothing about braille displays so be specific
when requesting the kind of ports you need on anything you buy from
them.  The blinux-list may be able to help with braille display
questions or the slint list though the slint list is for a specific
distribution of linux.

> 4. Are notetakers even really used anymore given the advance of smartphones?
> 4.1 What accessories or lack-thereof are visually impaired people using with their phones, if there is a move away from the more traditional notetaker?
> 5. Are any of you aware of any *BSD project dealing with braille/speech output specifically?

> On the off chance that notetakers are being phased out, run Windows anyway, don't have a video out, and run specialized CPUs incompatible with major versions of Linux?then I may need more time at the drawing board.
