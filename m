As I have said more than once, that is not how this article is being 
represented in the broader Linux community.
I will add that, by this person's own admission, clean up is the task he 
is *choosing* to focus  upon.
he is, according to those writing the article bringing accessibility to 
Fedora workstation.
i respect that for those in the know, in the choir so to speak what he is 
doing is clean up.
but that is not how the general Linux community is taking this 
information.
Best,
