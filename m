glen,
I am not asking for phone suggestions.
The secondary disability I experience means that allot of voices will 
trigger a seizure.
I am instead seeking the database, gari perhaps?  Going to search that, 
which  lets me search for what my body needs..and it is not blind branded 
in any way.
Thanks,
