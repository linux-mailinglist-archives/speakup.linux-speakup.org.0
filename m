Its interesting,
I have owned a reading edge since 1993  / 94 or so.
In that time I have needed to replace it only twice, perhaps on 3 
occasions, once because a staffer with delta airlines ignored my 
instructions  for  its storage.
I do keep a spare,  would not mind having one of them  passed on for parts 
to help someone else.
speaking personally, hardware synthesizers have become  apart of history 
largely because of factors outside of their benefit quality, or possible 
continued usefulness... but that is my personal opinion of course.
