Well Linux is not my main operating system, and I think it's a fair question 
to an email  list.
That is the biggest problem with Linux users, they think they are above 
helping people who aren't into that operating system as much as they are.
In my opinion, the only question that shouldn't be asked about on a list 
like this, is one that is repeatedly asked, as folks should save useful 
information that comes in through these lists, like I do, for later looking 
up the information already saved.
But there is so little traffic on these Linux lists, that I can only imagine 
that people have given up asking for guidance.
And the suggestion to a list member to google something, rather than 
helping,  is ludicrous, because the information you get from Google 
searches, is provided by lists like this, where people have asked the 
question before, and therefore, if questions don't get answered on these 
lists, then Google won't find answers for people searching on-line.
I have gotten some help here, but I don't understand why people bother to 
reply, or even be on a list if they don't want to help others.

Read the espeak/espeak-ng docs, like Didier said. There's no .conf file.
