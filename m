there was an interesting discussion a month or so back on the blinux list=
=20
about how long it took completing tasks in the gui as apposed to say=20
command line,  the comments were quite informative.
Still, fs has never marketed largely to the end user. Instead they market=
=20
to the American rehab community.
how much market research has  the rehab community done to support the need=
=20
for choices?
How many rehab counselors support  training in Linux?
one comment made by the subject of this thread about poor quality speech=20
is a fine one...out of the box Linux has few speech choices.  everyone=20
brings their needs to the table there.

if you want to get fs to care about Linux, you  need to prove there is=20
money for  them there, from their main source of income.
