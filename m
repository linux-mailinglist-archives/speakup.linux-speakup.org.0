Hi Rob,
Can you plug in a USB hub to one of the ports?

Subject: Installing OS on rackmount server


Tried this on another list, got no answer, so trying here. I've got a Cisco 
rackmount that needs an OS. It's only got 2 usb ports, so I can't hook up a 
keyboard, a braille display and a linux flash drive. I'm given to understand 
the CIMC interface is inaccessible, and I have no idea how to set up a PXE 
server. Is my only option for installing an OS to connect a hard drive to 
another computer, install linux on there and then put it in the server?
