Hello,

Didier Spaier, le mar. 12 janv. 2021 00:38:15 +0100, a ecrit:
> One more, similar to talkwith, handles also fenrir.

Is this supposed to completely replace talkwith?

Please see with talkwith users whether their needs are fullfilled by
this.  I don't think we want to maintain two tools doing the same thing.

So is this supposed to be only run interactively by users, and never by
scripts?

> 			chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.espeakup

This seems slint-specific.
