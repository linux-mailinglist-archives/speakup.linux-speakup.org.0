Good morning All,
At least it still is here.
So I'm wondering, will speakup use Voxin?
Seems like there is a way to launch it with a software synth.
Also, I don't recall how to launch speakup, it was working before I tried 
Fenrir.
Thanks a bunch.

Glenn

Well, Glen, there are good reasons for reading-and-contributing to more than 
a
single list. As an example, for awhile I tried Slint, but now I am 
completely
in Debian, but I still read-and-help when I can. I tried subscribing to 
Fenrir,
but I guess something didn't work. As far as your config, I hope you created 
a
user-and-system config. You just never can be sure which of these list you
might find an answer, including Blinux, but I certainly agree with Greg, let
your subject-line adequately represent your inquiree, even if it means
beginning a new thread.
Chime
