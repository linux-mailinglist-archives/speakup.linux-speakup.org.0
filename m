Wow, I do not think I have ever seen Wikipedia give warnings for bare URLs 
before.
To answer your questions,
Any web interface must work with lynx.
If not that kind of web interface, then I would prefer using ssh to reach 
this  inbox.
I am, for example, paying a  member of the Toronto Linux users group who 
enjoys mail servers to access my  gmail account using alpine.  He is not 
strong  in it, uses this  setup entirely for family or friends, making the 
extra  email not one I can use for this purpose.
There are some variation's on this possibility, but I am truly only seeking 
good email, perhaps yet another Linux shell, the one housing my gmail 
account  is Ubuntu, although with far far fewer tools than at shellworld 
etc.
