Hello,

The slides look good overall :)

For better readability (accessibility too? ;) ), I would say to avoid
the small shadow being letters.

I don't know which distros ship it, I'm afraid mostly only
accessibility-oriented ones. But going out of staging will help so much
on that front :)

On slide 6 the URL is split, you can reduce its font size a bit.

On slide 10 you could add a picture of the synth you have :)

On slide 13 you should write on the slide the answer to the
why-synth-to-CPU question, for people who will miss it in your talk:
synths report their speaking progress.

Slide 16: yes, a diagram would be useful :)

If you have the time before the deadline, on slides 7 and 18 you could
draw a picture to show the flow.


I don't know if you have already made this kind of presentation.  If
not, I strongly advise to train :) for two reasons:

- train by yourself to get an idea of how it fits in the 35 minutes you
  have, to know how much time you can spend on the details.

- train in from of colleagues or friends (who have some technical
  understanding), just to check how it feels to talk about it in front
  of people :) and get their feedback as well (even if you will not be
  able to change the slides).

Samuel
