	hello Glen.  Just because you cannot ssh into the box doesn't mean you cannot scp out of
it.  You would do the scp from the box itself, back to your working computer.  Yes, you'd be
doing this blind, but I'm guessing this could actualy work.

But, your idea of copying to a thumb drive would work too, assuming you can find the right
mount point.

anyway, good luck with the effort.

-thanks
-Brian
