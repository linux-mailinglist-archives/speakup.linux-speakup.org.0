I remember Kirk wrote a way of running Chromevox but I think it was mostly an 
interface to a graphical setup? On a laptop, I have been enjoying Voxin for a 
number of years, however, now I hear double speech, while arrowing down, I hear 
some of a previous line mixed with the current line. An Android speech which I 
enjoy on a Chrome Book, sound wonderful, so I wonder if I can enjoy that with 
Speakup? Thanks so much in advance
Chime
