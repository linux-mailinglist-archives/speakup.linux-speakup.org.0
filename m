1. I commented on my personal experience

only..not projecting it in a way that=20
applied to "blind people" generally as you do..
I would never project how I do things on to others, each person's=20
experiences  and needs are unique..something you do not choose to accept.

2. you said, some people ride to la  on horseback, while others prefer to=
=20
fly, which is far more of a challenge to my mind speaking personally.

  This is not about challenge. I do not care how you *personally*=20
accommodate.
it is when you claim it is uniform for everyone  representing yourself as=
=20
an example speaking for everyone that I differ.
Unless you want your comments on list, stop writing me privately...goodness=
=20
knows that would, speaking personally, be seen as harassment.
And, once something hits my private inbox from someone I clearly disagree=
=20
with?
  I will do what I want with that communication.

Karen, you challenged me. You accused me. Not the other way around. You jus=
t=20
keep accusing me of "projecting your single life experience onto everyone"

No, I am not doing that. I am giving the best technical advice I can.

We are not going to stop butting heads until you stop making that totally=
=20
unfair and bizarre accusation.

So a Are you going to stop accusing me of "projecting your single life=20
experience onto everyone'

Because I'm not doing that.
