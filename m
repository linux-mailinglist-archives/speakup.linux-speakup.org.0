Hi folks,
Asking about this within the thread, because it is possible someone 
recalls what I am seeking.
I am profoundly and desperately trying to find a replacement for the LG 
phone I have used for years.
Canada is retiring its 3g phone network, so I must find a phone with the 
features my body requires.
Things like speech at the ear, think lg exalt..which I would buy three 
weeks ago last Tuesday if I could find it unlocked.
Presently I have an lg f4nr, which is not a 4g item.
Anyway, there is? or was a database that allowed you to search wireless 
pones by feature, buttons, 3.5 headphone jacks, tts those sorts of things.
The list of options was huge, you checked off your requirements and it 
presented the phones with the items on your list, even if a lesser known 
brand.
Anyone recall the location of this tool?

With appreciation,
Karen
