For the record, I'm using debian sid. I've been using it for well over
25 years though. I do have it running on desktops and two Raspberry
Pis. I'm only running void on one machine. I'm only having trouble on
one machine but it continuously screws up. I'm not sure why it's just
one flakey distro but it happens to be my main machine so it's more
iritating I guess. If I could easily switch distros without having to
reinstall everything I certainly would.
