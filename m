I am not bashing anyone.
And who Said fedora is providing anything whatsoever for me at all?
Of course, i get asked by the general Linux users group sharing this=20
article to defend the limited thinking of a so  called professional,=20
because=20
of course everyone sharing a label with him can access just because he=20
can.
the very willingness  to cut this person some slack as a token=20
representation of red hat's desire to projectively stereotype is part of wh=
y=20
actual inclusion is problematical.
I am expected to know him, because he is represented to personify my=20
accommodation needs...and. he. does. not.
The fact it is free is  completely unimportant.
