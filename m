Hi folks,
Jason, I have yet to find a reading edge driver for Linux, that alone=20
keeps me  from seriously considering the operating system.
It would run on DOS which is what I use.
For now though, as I cannot tell what the sound issue might be, this=20
project will wait.
Indeed though  all the screen readers I have checked, still need to try=20
ASAP run the .bat file as it were, all finding the  card too.
At the moment my main source of synthesis is doing better, what a=20
difference changing a cable can make!
Thanks all,
Kare
