What are these requirements that are missing in shellworld?  Could we
configure a vps on panix.com to do the right thing and you would send
all your Email through that, or use the shell on that server?  Their
web interface would work with lynx, I am not using lynx with it, but
it will work that way.
Contact me off list and we can talk by phone.
