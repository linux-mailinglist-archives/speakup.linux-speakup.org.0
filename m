Hi Karen,

I am not aware of any arguments for links the chain to improve readability.

With either links (the chain) , lynx (the cat), or w3m,
I get the best results with a combination of browser keys to get me 
close to the target text, and speakup keys. to actually read it.
With all the text clutter on most pages, your best bet is to become familiar with
specific landmarks on the site you want to review so you
can jump straight to your target using the text search functions.
For example, I use slash day of week, /Friday to
jump to the latest article links on realclearpolitics.com.
