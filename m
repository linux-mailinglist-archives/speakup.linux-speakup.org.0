Hi there,
Just wondering, how much were they going to charge you?
All of my domain, save the one here in Canada are with gkg.net
www.gkg.net.
I spend on average $12 a year,  with the amazing ability to update with 
them  on the phone.
Even my Canadian domain with bare medal
www.baremedal.ca  I hope lol, is little more than $14.
why is yours so expensive?
just wondering,
Kare
